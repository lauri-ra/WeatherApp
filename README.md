# Overview
In this group project the groups were tasked to design and implement software for monitoring and displaying weather data. The project work was done in a group of 3. My responsibility was helping with creating the initial Figma prototype. In the implementation phase I worked on the DigiTraffic functionalities that fetch and modify the data Controller classes for getting user inputs and displaying it. The project was implemented following the MVC Design Pattern. Documentation folder contains more information about the design and implementation process.
